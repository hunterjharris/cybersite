        <p>I'm Hunter, but you can call me Hunt, fresh outta hacker-bootcamp. A bit green I know, but you gatta
            start somewhere. Check out my stats.</p>

                    <p>HTML was part of the bootcamp, sure,
                    but I'd be lying if I didn't say I was already familiar with it.
                    After all, I used to style my Myspace page back in '05.

                    <p>It's true! CSS was part of the course. No shame in admitting it.
                    Once you get decent at it, it becomes kinda fun! Like anything, you know?
                    Funny how that works. If it wasn't clear, I sort of just picked the most
                    cursed looking fonts I could find. One of my many talents.

            I'm a <span class="underline">pro</span>grammer.
            <br>
            Although I suppose you could
            <br>
            call me a <span class="underline">low</span>grammer.
            <br>
            What can I say?
            <br>
            I'm in a tight spot, a real tight spot.
            <br>
            So tight that its hard to breathe!
            <br>
            Oh well, life's the shits.
        </p>

        <p class="two">
            This is an example of how green I am.
            <br>
            You can probably tell
            <br>
            just from looking at it
            <br>
            I suppose it's not<span class="underline">that</span>bad..
            <br>
            What can I say?
            <br>
            I'm in a tight spot, a real tight spot.
            <br>
            So tight that it feels like
            <br>
            the walls are caving in!
            <br>
            Oh well, life's the shits.

        <p class="three">
            Part of me<br> is wondering
            <br>
            "What good is <br>a website anyway?"
            <br>
            Just from the<br> thought of it,
            <br>
            It seema a bit <br>conceided, no?
            <br>
            What can I say?
            <br>
            I'm in a tight spot, <br>a real tight spot.
            <br>
            So tight that it feels like
            <br>
            maybe I should <br>make a run for it!
            <br>
            Oh well, <br>life's the shits.
        </p>

        <p class="four">
            You've got me thinking
            <br>
            "What kind of <br> website can impress<br> a complete stranger?"
            <br>
            I'm not so sure but
            <br>
            I'm thinking<br> something flashy!
            <br>
            What can I say?
            <br>
            I'm in a tight spot,<br> a real tight spot.
            <br>
            So tight<br> that it feels like
            <br>
            I probably need<br> to take a nap.
            <br>
            Oh well, <br> life's the shits.
        </p>


        <p class="five">
            You know, <br>the top of this page says,
            <br>
            "Couldn't be bothered<br> to get a degree"
            <br>
            So true!<br> Don't you think?
            <br>
            Maybe a bit silly, <br>but who can read it?
            <br>
            Ha, ha, ha!
            <br>
            What can I say?
            <br>
            I'm in a tight spot, <br>a real tight spot.
            <br>
            So tight <br>that
            <br>
            it makes me <br> wanna boogie!
            <br>
            Oh well, <br>life's the shits.
